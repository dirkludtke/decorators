# Decorators

This is the material for my presentation at the PyBCN Python Meetup in April 2025.

Main part is a Jupyter notebook [decorators.ipynb](decorators.ipynb).

For modifying and running the code, you could upload it to the trial area of the Jupyter project (https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter) or install the Jupyter tools locally. Alternatively, you could install a Jupyter extension of your favorite IDE.

If this is too complicated, you could also run the Python examples inside the [src](src) folder. There, you will be missing the segmentation and inline explanations.
